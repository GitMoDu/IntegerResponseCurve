# Integer Response Curve
Set of, Arduino compatible, response curve functions, optimized using integer only maths.
Features:

- Optional saturation of response (integer scaling of filter strength).
- Optional output range limiting.


Provided with a set of template to expand functionality, including:

- Templates for 8 bit and 16 bit wide curves.
- Sign conversion of unsigned curve to mirrored signed curve.
- Double chaining.
